This project is made for raspberry-pi.
The aim is to provide a comprehensive web ui for remote control, and scheduling of actions of an electronic circuit.

The web ui can be used to:
  1. Turn the circuit off/on
  2. Schedule to turn the circuit off/on:
    a. At a specific time every day
    b. At a specific time of a specific day

I use Express for backend, ejs for frontend and python to interact with raspberry-pi's GPIO.
